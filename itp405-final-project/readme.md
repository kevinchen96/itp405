This site will be used as a tennis match setup using google maps api to show locations on a map. Users will be able to login, make tennis events, and join tennis events. Tennis players of any age at any level will visit the site to either create events or join events made by friends/family. They do not need an account to view events via search bar, but they will need to make an account to see existing events and create/join events. The Google Maps API will be used to display the location on a map. There will be tables for users and events.

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, queueing, and caching.

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb inversion of control container, expressive migration system, and tightly integrated unit testing support give you the tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.
